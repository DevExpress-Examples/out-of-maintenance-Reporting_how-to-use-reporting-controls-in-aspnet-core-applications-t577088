# How to use reporting controls in ASP.NET Core applications


This example demonstrates how to use theÂ <a href="https://docs.devexpress.com/XtraReports/400249/create-end-user-reporting-applications/web-reporting/asp-net-core-reporting/end-user-report-designer">End-User Report Designer</a>Â andÂ <a href="https://docs.devexpress.com/XtraReports/400248/create-end-user-reporting-applications/web-reporting/asp-net-core-reporting/document-viewer">HTML5 Document Viewer</a>Â in an ASP.NET Core application that targets both .NET Standard and .NET Framework.


These are the main steps to integrate these controls into an application:

1. Install theÂ **DevExpress.AspNetCore.Reporting**Â <a href="https://www.nuget.org/">NuGet</a>Â package.

2. Install **devexpress-reporting** <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/devexpress-reporting">npm</a> package.

3. Register reporting services in the **Startup** class.

4. Reference all the required client resources in the View file.

5. Use the <a href="https://docs.devexpress.com/XtraReports/DevExpress.AspNetCore.BuilderFactoryExtensions.ReportDesigner.overloads">ReportDesigner</a> and <a href="https://docs.devexpress.com/XtraReports/DevExpress.AspNetCore.BuilderFactoryExtensions.WebDocumentViewer.overloads">WebDocumentViewer </a> wrappers to display reporting controls on your web pages.


Before running this example, do the following:

1. In Visual Studio, right-click the **package.json** file and select **Restore Packages**. This adds the node_modules folder to the application project.

2. Right-click the ASP.NET Core application and select **ManageÂ NuGet Packages**. In the invoked window, switch to theÂ **Updates** page and update the **DevExpress.AspNetCore.Reporting**Â package.Â You may need to add a new NuGet package source to install DevExpress packagesÂ <a href="https://www.devexpress.com/Support/Center/Question/Details/T466415/devexpress-nuget-packages">online</a>Â or offline from theÂ **C:\Program Files (x86)\DevExpress 18.2\Components\System\Components\packages</strong><em>Â </em>path.**
