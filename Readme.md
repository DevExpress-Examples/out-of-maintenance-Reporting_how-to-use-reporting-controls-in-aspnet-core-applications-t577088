# End-User Report Designer and Document Viewer in ASP.NET Core Application


This example demonstrates how to use theÂ [End-User Report Designer](https://docs.devexpress.com/XtraReports/400249)Â andÂ [HTML5 Document Viewer](https://docs.devexpress.com/XtraReports/400248) in an ASP.NET Core application.


Prior to running this example, perform the following steps:

1. In Visual Studio, right-click the **package.json** file and select **Restore Packages**. This adds the node_modules folder to the application project.

2. Right-click the ASP.NET Core project file and select **ManageÂ NuGet Packages**. In the invoked window, switch to theÂ **Updates** page and update the **DevExpress.AspNetCore.Reporting**Â package.Â You may need to add a new NuGet package source to [install DevExpress NuGet packages](https://docs.devexpress.com/GeneralInformation/115912)Â or update them from the [local NuGet feed](https://docs.devexpress.com/GeneralInformation/401140).

3. Check whether you have the [latest Node.js version](https://nodejs.org/) installed and uninstall any previous version. To check Node.js version, type **node** at the command prompt.
